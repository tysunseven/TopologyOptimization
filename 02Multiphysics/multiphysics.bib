            Thermal metamaterials are typically achieved by mixing different natural materials to realize effective thermal conductivities (ETCs) that conventional materials do not possess. However, the necessity for multifunctional design of metamaterials, encompassing both thermal and mechanical functionalities, is somewhat overlooked, resulting in the fixation of mechanical properties in thermal metamaterials designed within current research endeavors. Thus far, conventional methods have faced challenges in designing thermal metamaterials with configurable mechanical properties because of intricate inherent relationships among the structural configuration, thermal and mechanical properties in metamaterials. Here, a data‐driven approach is proposed to design a thermal metamaterial capable of seamlessly achieving thermal functionalities and harnessing the advantages of microstructural diversity to configure its mechanical properties. The designed metamaterial possesses thermal cloaking functionality while exhibiting exceptional mechanical properties, such as load‐bearing capacity, shearing strength, and tensile resistance, thereby affording mechanical protection for the thermal metadevice. The proposed approach can generate numerous distinct inverse design candidate topological functional cells (TFCs), designing thermal metamaterials with dramatic improvements in mechanical properties compared to traditional ones, which sets up a novel paradigm for discovering thermal metamaterials with extraordinary mechanical structures. Furthermore, this approach also paves the way for investigating thermal metamaterials with additional physical properties.},

	abstract = {The present work has been conducted in order to introduce a novel approach for the design of mechanical devices conceived to manipulate the displacements ﬁeld in linear elastic materials subjected to thermal gradients. Such an approach involves the solution of a topology optimization problem where the objective function deﬁnes the error in achieving a prescribed displacement ﬁeld, and the mechanical device consists of two macroscopically distinguishable isotropic candidate materials. The material distribution is deﬁned as a continuous function by following the solid isotropic microstructure (or material) with penalization (SIMP) method. The so-designed devices are easy to manufacture, since the design variables dictate the candidate materials distribution. Based on such an approach it is not necessary to devise further ways to simultaneously mimicking several thermal and mechanical effective properties, as required by coordinates transformation-based metamaterial design methods. Although the candidate materials are isotropic, the mechanical device behaves as a metamaterial allowing the desired manipulation of the displacements ﬁeld. As an example, this topology optimization-based approach is applied to the design of an elastostatic cloaking device subjected to thermal gradients, considering also thermodependent mechanical properties.},

The level-set model precisely speciﬁes the material regions and their sharp boundaries in contrast to a raster discretization of the conventional homogenization-based approaches. Combined with the classical shape derivatives, the level-set method yields a computational system of partial diﬀerential equations. In using the Eulerian computation scheme with a ﬁxed rectilinear grid and a ﬁxed mesh in the unit cell, the gradient descent solution of the optimization captures the interfacial boundaries naturally and performs topological changes accurately. The proposed method is illustrated with several 2D examples for the synthesis of heterogeneous microstructures of elastic and/or thermoelastic composites composed of two and three material phases.},

            The computational cost of traditional gradient-based topology optimization is amplified for multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) problems, most notably when coupling between physics disciplines is accounted for. To alleviate this, we investigate new methods and applications of generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a surrogate for MDO. Accepting physical fields from each physics discipline as input, the trained network produces an optimal design that closely resembles that of the iterative gradient-based approach. With this model as a baseline, we introduce a novel architecture that performs physics-based design enhancement of optimal single-physics designs to produce multiphysics designs. By providing the network with boundary conditions from a secondary physics discipline, we obtain multiphysics structures while avoiding the need for costly coupled multiphysics analysis, thereby generating significant savings in computational effort. We demonstrate our approach by designing a series of structures optimized for both thermal and elastic performance. With the physics-based design enhancement GAN, we obtain thermoelastic structures that outperform those produced by the baseline multiphysics GAN architecture.},

This vision motivates the pursuit of mechanical metamaterials that interact with the environment in a programmable fashion.

Here, we use computational morphogenesis and multimaterial polymer 3D printing to systematically create soft metamaterials with arbitrarily programmable temperature-switchable nonlinear mechanical responses under large deformations. This is made possible by harnessing the distinct glass transition temperatures of different polymers, which, when optimally synthesized, produce local and giant stiffness changes in a controllable manner. Featuring complex geometries, the generated structures and metamaterials exhibit fundamentally different yet programmable nonlinear force-displacement relations and deformation patterns as temperature varies. The rational design and fabrication establish an objective-oriented synthesis of metamaterials with freely tunable thermally adaptive behaviors. This imbues structures and materials with environment-aware intelligence.

            Stiffness is a mechanical property of vital importance to any material system and is typically considered a static quantity. Recent work, however, has shown that novel materials with programmable stiffness can enhance the performance and simplify the design of engineered systems, such as morphing wings, robotic grippers, and wearable exoskeletons. For many of these applications, the ability to program stiffness with electrical activation is advantageous because of the natural compatibility with electrical sensing, control, and power networks ubiquitous in autonomous machines and robots. The numerous applications for materials with electrically driven stiffness modulation has driven a rapid increase in the number of publications in this field. Here, a comprehensive review of the available materials that realize electroprogrammable stiffness is provided, showing that all current approaches can be categorized as using electrostatics or electrically activated phase changes, and summarizing the advantages, limitations, and applications of these materials. Finally, a perspective identifies state‐of‐the‐art trends and an outlook of future opportunities for the development and use of materials with electroprogrammable stiffness.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional lattices are ideal candidate for developing artiﬁcially engineered materials and structures across different length-scales, leading to unprecedented multi-functional mechanical properties which can not be achieved in naturally occurring materials and systems. Characterization of effective elastic properties of these lattices is essential for their adoption as structural elements of various devices and systems. An enormous amount of research has been conducted on different geometry of lattices to identify and characterize various parameters which affect the elastic properties. However, till date we can not control the elastic properties actively for a lattice microstructure, meaning that the elastic properties of such lattices are not truly programmable. All the parameters that control the effective elastic properties are passive in nature. After manufacturing the lattice structure with a certain set of geometric or material-based parameters, there is no room to modulate the properties further. In this article, we propose a hybrid lattice micro-structure by integrating piezo-electric materials with the members of the lattice for active voltage-dependent modulation of elastic properties. A bottom-up multi-physics based analytical framework leading to closed-form formulae is derived for hexagonal lattices to demonstrate the concept of active lattices. It is noticed that the Young’s moduli are voltage-dependent, while the shear modulus and the Poisson’s ratios are not functions of the applied voltage. Thus, the compound mechanics of deformation induced by external mechanical stresses and electric ﬁeld lead to an active control over the Young’s moduli as a function of voltage. Interestingly, it turns out that a programmable statetransition of the Young’s moduli from positive to negative values with a wide range can be achieved in such hybrid lattices. The physics-based analytical framework for active modulation of voltagedependent elastic properties on the basis of operational demands provide the necessary physical insights and conﬁdence for potential practical exploitation of the proposed concept in various futuristic multifunctional structural systems and devices across different length-scales.},

In this perspective, we provide an overview of mechanical metamaterials within and beyond their classical mechanical functionalities. We discuss various aspects of data-driven approaches for inverse design and optimization of multifunctional mechanical metamaterials. Our aim is to provide new roadmaps for design and discovery of next-generation active and responsive mechanical metamaterials that can interact with the surrounding environment and adapt to various conditions while inheriting all outstanding mechanical features of classical mechanical metamaterials. Next, we deliberate the emerging mechanical metamaterials with specific functionalities to design informative and scientific intelligent devices.

              ). However, the underlying idea of designing material properties is not that narrow. More broadly, one rationally designs a subwavelength unit cell from existing constituent materials and (periodically) arranges it into an artificial solid. The properties of that solid are then determined by structure rather than chemistry and can be tailored, extreme, or even qualitatively unprecedented. Rational design is the key and makes metamaterials a rather particular class of composite materials.},

Here, we propose general arbitrary-shape transformation multiphysics metamaterials (TMM) based on a discretion-and-assembly strategy. As proof-of-concept, we designed several arbitrary-shape TMMs to achieve the robust manipulation of heat and electric current for different combinations of cloaking/concentrating functions. The recipe of the general TMM includes coupling the multiphysics anisotropic parameters, offering a general strategy to fabricate metamaterials, endowing the shape ﬂexibility, and enabling the functionality robustness.

            An invisibility cloak to conceal objects from an outside observer has long been a subject of interest in metamaterial design. While cloaks have been manufactured for optical, thermal, and electric fields, limited progress has been made for mechanical cloaks. Most existing designs rely on mapping-based methods, which have so far been limited to special base cells and a narrow selection of voids with simple shapes. In this study, we develop a fundamentally different approach by exploiting data-driven designs to offer timely, customized solutions to mechanical cloaking that were previously difficult to obtain. Through simulations and experimental validations, we show that excellent cloaking performance can be achieved for various boundary conditions, shapes of voids, base cells, and even multiple voids.
          , 
            Mechanical cloaks are materials engineered to manipulate the elastic response around objects to make them indistinguishable from their homogeneous surroundings. Typically, methods based on material-parameter transformations are used to design optical, thermal, and electric cloaks. However, they are not applicable in designing mechanical cloaks, since continuum-mechanics equations are not form invariant under general coordinate transformations. As a result, existing design methods for mechanical cloaks have so far been limited to a narrow selection of voids with simple shapes. To address this challenge, we present a systematic, data-driven design approach to create mechanical cloaks composed of aperiodic metamaterials using a large precomputed unit cell database. Our method is flexible to allow the design of cloaks with various boundary conditions, multiple loadings, different shapes and numbers of voids, and different homogeneous surroundings. It enables a concurrent optimization of both topology and properties distribution of the cloak. Compared to conventional fixed-shape solutions, this results in an overall better cloaking performance and offers unparalleled versatility. Experimental measurements on additively manufactured structures further confirm the validity of the proposed approach. Our research illustrates the benefits of data-driven approaches in quickly responding to new design scenarios and resolving the computational challenge associated with multiscale designs of functional structures. It could be generalized to accommodate other applications that require heterogeneous property distribution, such as soft robots and implants design.},

For instance, the thermal cloaking effect may be deteriorated when background changes, which limits its practical application signiﬁcantly. By deducing the effective thermal conductivities of rotating objects, we propose an adaptive thermal cloaking metadevice that is composed by three rotating layers with different roles. The joint effect of three rotating layers makes the effective thermal conductivity a real number on the reciprocity line for feasible implementation. When background changes, we only need change the angular velocities rather than change the conﬁguration or the constituent materials to restore the cloaking effect, which is much more convenient and real-time for practical applications. The underlying physics of the rotating thermal cloak is discussed to identify the key parameters and upper and lower limits of the effective thermal conductivity for further improving the cloaking effect. The present study can trigger more rotating metadevices for novel applications beyond thermal cloaking.},

This work introduces a powerful topology optimization framework to guide the rational design of hard-magnetic soft materials and structures with precisely programmable functionalities under large deformations. Built upon a unified design parameterization scheme, the proposed framework is capable of simultaneously optimizing topology, remnant magnetization distribution, and applied magnetic fields. Thus, guided by the analytical gradient information, our framework can effectively explore the entire design space to search for optimized structures with multiple target functionalities, such as programmable deformations and maximized actuation, under the corresponding optimized magnetic fields. Through five design examples, we showcase applications of the proposed framework in generating optimized shape-programming metastructures and robots, magnetic actuators, and unit cells with encoded and adaptable modes. We demonstrate how simultaneous optimization in topology, magnetization distribution, and applied magnetic field can greatly improve the performance of a design, and highlight the importance of accounting for finite-rotation kinematics to capture the influence of body torque-related magnetic force on the optimized remnant magnetization distribution. Various optimized magnetic-responsive designs with comparable performances yet distinct mechanisms are discovered, showing the effectiveness of the proposed framework to generate unconventional designs with highly programmable magnetic-actuated behaviors. We envision that the proposed topology optimization framework can potentially benefit the design process in a wide spectrum of magnetic-responsive applications, such as soft robots, magnetic actuators, and programmable metamaterials.},

These metasurfaces remain planar in their initial configurations and are deformed into complex 3D target shapes. The proposed framework accounts for large-deformation kinematics and optimizes both the topologies and magnetization distributions of metasurfaces in conjunction with the directions and magnitudes of the external magnetic fields. We demonstrate the framework in the design of kirigami metasurfaces, bio-inspired robots with “swimming”, “steering”, “walking”, and “climbing” motions, and multi-modal magnetic actuators, and the optimized designs show high precision and performance in achieving complex 3D deformations. We also use a hybrid fabrication procedure to manufacture representative designs and conduct experimental tests to validate their programmed 3D deformations, with results showing good agreement with simulation predictions.

            Mechanical metamaterials are meticulously designed structures with exceptional mechanical properties determined by their microstructures and constituent materials. Tailoring their material and geometric distribution unlocks the potential to achieve unprecedented bulk properties and functions. However, current mechanical metamaterial design considerably relies on experienced designers' inspiration through trial and error, while investigating their mechanical properties and responses entails time‐consuming mechanical testing or computationally expensive simulations. Nevertheless, recent advancements in deep learning have revolutionized the design process of mechanical metamaterials, enabling property prediction and geometry generation without prior knowledge. Furthermore, deep generative models can transform conventional forward design into inverse design. Many recent studies on the implementation of deep learning in mechanical metamaterials are highly specialized, and their pros and cons may not be immediately evident. This critical review provides a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of deep learning in property prediction, geometry generation, and inverse design of mechanical metamaterials. Additionally, this review highlights the potential of leveraging deep learning to create universally applicable datasets, intelligently designed metamaterials, and material intelligence.
