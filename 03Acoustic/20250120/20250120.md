Macroscopic topology optimization, rather than multi-scale topology optimization.

Learn the numerical calculation methods of sound absorption coefficients.

The energy of sound is divided into three parts: reflected, transmitted, and dissipated.

Enclosed by an acoustically "hard wall," with no transmitted portion.

$$
P(x) = A e^{-ikx} + B e^{ikx},\quad R=\frac{B}{A},\quad \alpha=1-|R|^2

To calculate the sound absorption coefficient, it is necessary to solve the equations to determine p1​ and p2​. The equation for sound propagation is
$$
  \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2(x) \nabla^2 p.
  $$

The steady-state acoustic pressure p of an acoustic domain is governed by

where the symbols ρ and κ denote the density and bulk modulus of the acoustic medium filled in the domain, respectively.

quarter-wavelength resonance

a three-quarter-wavelength resonance forms to achieve the sound absorption coefficient nearly equal to 1 at f = f3, while the quarter-wavelength resonance makes the first absorption peak at the frequency lower than 2000 Hz.
